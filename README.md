An online alternative to REBGV's existing 'Data Input Form' (a PDF) â€” built using Vue.js 3.

### To-dos

* Refine the data structure
  * Fill out the "maximum" attribute for inputs and textareas
  * Add a "pattern" attribute â€” for basic data validation, especially for number fields
  * Subarea dropdown should filter based on the area selected. (And be greyed out prior to an area being selected.)
  * Some fields should deactivate based on the answer of others (e.g. 'will fixtures be removed?')
  * Some fields should be deactivated from the start and only calculate input from other fields (e.g. floor area, multifamily income)
* Refine the design
  * Add a PrimeVue toggle button to switch between feet and metres
  * Hide fields according to the property type that's been selected. Simplifies things for the user ðŸ™‚
  * Could look at SimpleTax for inspiration â€” they handle complex forms elegantly
* Bugs
  * Check propagation of data from `<FormRoom>` and `<FormBathroom>` to `<App>`

### Common commands

* Project setup on a new machine: `npm install`
* Access GUI when using @vue/cli: `vue ui`
* Compile for development, with hot-reloading: `npm run serve`
* Compile and minify for production: `npm run build`
* Lint and fix files: `npm run lint`
