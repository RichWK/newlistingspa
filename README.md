An online alternative to REBGV's existing 'Data Input Form' (a PDF).

### To-dos

* Refine the data structure
  * Add a "maximum selected" attribute â€” to limit the number of checkboxes which can be selected. (Different fields have different requirements.)
  * Add a "pattern" attribute â€” for basic data validation, especially for number fields
  * A few fields need the ability to specify a "note". (e.g. 'Age Type', 'Units in Development'.) Maybe this could be an icon which reveals details when tapped / on mouseover.
  * Area and subarea dropdowns don't yet contain the correct data
* Refine the design
  * Could look at SimpleTax for inspiration â€” they handle complex forms elegantly
  * New field types
    * Currency
    * Textarea
    * PrimeVue toggle button for switching between feet and metres
    * Decimal
  * Show `<h2>` for any `<FormSelection>` whose data specifies a label attribute
  * Hide fields according to the property type selected by the user. Simplifies things ðŸ™‚

### Common commands

* Project setup on a new machine: `npm install`
* Access GUI when using @vue/cli: `vue ui`
* Compile for development, with hot-reloading: `npm run serve`
* Compile and minify for production: `npm run build`
* Lint and fix files: `npm run lint`
