An online alternative to REBGV's existing 'Data Input Form' (a PDF).

### To-dos

* Refine the data structure
  * Fill out the "maximum" attribute for inputs and textareas
  * Add a "pattern" attribute â€” for basic data validation, especially for number fields
  * A few fields need the ability to specify a "note". (e.g. 'Age Type', 'Units in Development'.) Maybe this could be an icon which reveals details when tapped / on mouseover.
  * Subarea dropdown should filter based on the area selected. (And be greyed out prior to an area being selected.)
* Refine the design
  * Fade out other radio button options once one has been selected, mimicking checkbox selection behaviour once the max has been reached. But â€” they should remain selectable
  * Create `<FormBathroom>` and `<FormOpenHouse>`
  * `<FormRepeatingField>` needs some work. Perhaps it would be better to use PrimeVue's DataTable component?
  * New field types
    * PrimeVue toggle button for switching between feet and metres
  * Show `<h2>` for any `<FormSelection>` whose data specifies a label attribute
  * Hide fields according to the property type that's been selected. Simplifies things for the user ðŸ™‚
  * Could look at SimpleTax for inspiration â€” they handle complex forms elegantly
* Bugs
  * Clearing fields within `<FormRepeatingField>` does not clear the data

### Common commands

* Project setup on a new machine: `npm install`
* Access GUI when using @vue/cli: `vue ui`
* Compile for development, with hot-reloading: `npm run serve`
* Compile and minify for production: `npm run build`
* Lint and fix files: `npm run lint`
